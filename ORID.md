Objective: I have learned the basic principles of Restful API design and the initial operations of SpringBoot.
Reflective: I find this new knowledge intriguing which is challenging in practice. This feeling makes me 
            even more eager to fully master these technologies.
Interpretive: My excitement reflects my enthusiasm for new technologies and my desire to master them. 
            The difficulties in coding suggest that I need more time and practice to become proficient with these new technologies.
Decisional: I plan to continue my in-depth study of these technologies. To this end, I will allocate at least one to two hours daily 
        for dedicated learning and enhance my practical skills through actual projects. I believe that through continuous effort and practice, 
        I can master these technologies more quickly and play a significant role in future projects.
